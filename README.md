# US_Term_Structure-Time-Series-Analysis-
This Analysis is performed using Eviews
The Aim of the project is as follows :
Using the data in US Term Structure, test the series m1, m2, m3, m6, Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5 for unit root.
Using the Johansen test, check the cointegration rank of the whole vector (refer to Hall et all paper
for the comment).
Describe how all the cointegration relations look like. Consider the pair of rates m1, Y1. Test, using
the Engle/Granger methodology or the Johansen methodology, if the spread is the cointegrating
vector. Discuss whether your findings may be consistent with implications that can be derived from
the Expectations Hypothesis.
[Note about the dataset: the DF unit root test for m1 may have different outcomes (rejection or not)
depending on the specified model. Choose the same order as the DF unit root test for y1]

Detailed report of the analysis is attached feel free to reach me for any queries.
Thank You!
